# Synopsis

The dataset contains hyperspectral images for of minnow fishes with the objective of investigating if freshness of
the fish can be estimated using hyperspectral imaging.


## Dataset description
-One fish was obtained and imaged on 8/6. Afterwards it were stored in the deep freeze

-The fish was defrosted and imaged on 9/6. The fish was subsequently stored in normal
cooling conditions

-The fish was defrosted and imaged on 12/6. 

## Measurements 
For each fish, a hyperspectral image of 25 bands was acquired in the wavelength 680-970nm
Then five pixels, corresponding to different regions of the fish, were selected and the corresponding
spectral profile for each pixel was extracted.
The extracted spectral profiles were stored as plots and in csv files
