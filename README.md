## Synopsis

The dataset contains hyperspectral images for of minnow fishes with the objective of investigating if freshness of
the fish can be estimated using hyperspectral imaging.


## Dataset description
Three fishes were obtained and imaged on 8/6. Afterwards they were stored in the deep freeze

One fish was defrosted and imaged on 9/6. The fishes were subsequently stored in normal
cooling conditions

The two other fishes will be imaged on two additional days.

## Measurements 
For each fish, a hyperspectral image of 25 bands was acquired in the wavelength 680-970nm
Then five pixels, corresponding to different regions of the fish, were selected and the corresponding
spectral profile for each pixel was extracted.
The extracted spectral profiles were stored as plots and in csv files
